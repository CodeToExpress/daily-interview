# Interview Discussion Day 18 -- Today's Topic

**👨‍💻 Freelancing or Salary Job? 👨‍💻**

Many people have different viewpoints regarding both, and people generally go through this confusion which one to choose. 🤔
There are a lot of misconceptions about Freelancing. 😵
I keep on hearing these statements like "Bro freelancing is Best", "You are your own boss if you are a freelancer" and what not. 😮😲
And the irony is, I get to hear these things from people who have never even tried freelancing 😂 Those who are freelance developers, have a slightly different opinion. 💭

So let's have a look at some pros and cons of freelancing today, and will do it for salaried jobs tomorrow 😁

Pros of Freelancing 🤩

👉 More flexibility, not a 9 to 5 job basically

👉 Many people freelance for side income while they are a student

👉 Earn while you learn. Many people start freelancing while they are still learning a skill

👉 No "Office Politics"

👉 Choose your own work hours

👉 Choose the work you want to do

👉 Bargain the amount you will be getting

Cons of freelancing 😔

👉 Income/Salary is not fixed, it depends on how much work you get

👉 No employee benefits (like holidays, insurance, paid vacations, bonuses, other prizes etc)

👉 Lack of working environment which one gets in office

👉 Again, the employer can also bargain the amount to be paid (taking this point as a pro or con depends on your skills)

👉 Your employer might follow up too much, which makes the job annoying

👉 Frequent changes in deliverables

👉 Unprofessional employers (sometimes)

So I guess you have an idea about freelance jobs now, tomorrow we'll discuss about permanent jobs, then it'll be more clear whether to go for freelancing or permanenet job 😊
