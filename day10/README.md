# Interview Discussion Day 1 -- Today's Topic

**Things to keep in mind during an interview**

## Common views

- Always be calm, and answer the question that has been asked (An interview is not a high school term-end paper where you can write stories and get marks).
- Always think in a positive direction, negative answers reflect your negative attitude towards things
- Donâ€™t try to memorize the answers, just have many sessions of mock interviews before attempting any interview so that it doesn't seem overwhelming
- Sell what the buyer wants to buy! Match your abilities with the needs of the employer
- Think for a moment before you answer, a pause is better than a wrong answer
- Try to turn weakness into strengths, but never try to hide any weakness
- Be optimistic and believe in yourself
- BE HONEST, NEVER LIE
