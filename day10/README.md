# Interview Discussion Day 10 -- Today's Topic of discussion

**The Post-Interview Silence**

If you've ever given an interview you might know how bad the post-interview silence feels. So, let's suppose you gave an interview and you are sure that you are going to get selected, but days and weeks pass but you don't get any reply from the employer. How would you handle the situation?

My views are:

ðŸ‘‰ Until it is 100% sure that you are rejected, have patience

ðŸ‘‰ Don't stop applying in different companies

ðŸ‘‰ Introspect

ðŸ‘‰ Review your interview, try to remember all the things where you might have gone wrong and write them down in a note. Learn from your mistakes

In case it is confirmed that you are not selected

ðŸ‘‰ Don't lose hope. I am firm believer of the fact that every event occurs in your life at a specific time when it is best for you (Often blessings come disguised as a curse). 

ðŸ‘‰ Believe in yourself and your skills.

Apart from this, after any rejection it is (according to me), important to ask yourself these important questions

ðŸ‘‰ Were you professional?

ðŸ‘‰ Were you qualified enough?

ðŸ‘‰ Were you confident?

ðŸ‘‰ Did you give correct answers?

ðŸ‘‰ Were you prepared for the interview?

If the answer to any of the above-mentioned question is a "no", then instead of feeling dejected, start preparing for your next interview.
