# Interview Discussion Day 2 - Today‚Äôs Question

> Tell me about yourself

This is a sure shot question that you are going to face no matter what interview you are giving, and this question gives you the perfect opportunity to leave the ‚Äúperfect first impression‚Äù on the interviewer.

### Where people go wrong?

Many candidates are unprepared and mostly go into the interview without any specific answers or rehearsal for such general questions. This could be a very big mistake since your introduction is the first impression that the interviewer is going to have about you.

Most people stumble while introducing themselves, tell bullshit stories from their past life, or tell some things that are already written in the resume. This is to be noted that many people just say exactly word to word the points which are already written in the resume, which is actually the worst strategy one can think of. For example, what is the use of telling, ‚ÄúHello, I am ‚Äòxyz‚Äô, I am 21 years old, I studied in ‚Äòabc‚Äô school, I was in the school council etc.‚Äù All these things are already written clearly in your resume.

Clearly, it is a very important question which must not be answered with randomly. A good answer to this question would start with a small greeting followed by your qualifications and how you are the best fit for the job.

The condition is really similar, you have to match your abilities to the needs of the employer. So a little homework is required prior to sitting in any interview. Find out about the role and what all skills are needed for that role. If your skills match the role, perfect, if not then don‚Äôt lie but try to focus on the similar roles you‚Äôve taken up in past which would help you learn the requirements for this role at a very fast pace.

After uncovering what the employer is looking for, describe why the needs of this job fit with your profile, take examples of the tasks and jobs you have succeeded in before, give some examples of your responsibilities and achievements etc.

Once you‚Äôve found out the needs, and you think you are fit for the role, then be confident, and believe in yourself.

**Here‚Äôs a very general example of how I would introduce myself**. (Note that this is a short and typical answer, it does not pay focus to only one ‚Äúdesirable‚Äù aspect that interviewer might be looking for. So do not just copy paste it üòú)

```
A cadet by nature and a developer by passion, I expertise in web development.

My name (as you are already aware of) is Madhav Bahl and I am a full stack web developer proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS and related frameworks and libraries like MaterializeCSS, Bootstrap, skeleton, React (JS library) etc.
I devote much of my free time to open source contributions on GitHub which keeps me updated to several coding practises and guidelines. I am also a part of several technical communities in and out of my college, and have achieved positions in many hackathons and other competitions.

My aim is to make the youth of this world well versed with programming and technology, and being a tech blogger (link: https://medium.com/@madhavbahl10) I keep writing articles that would help out beginners in tech.
I am passionate about building communities centered around interest groups that can help out people with mutual goals, and with the blend of my technical and management skills, I keep taking initiatives to give back to the community from which I have learned so many wonderful things.

I formed a community called "Logic Xcution"(https://github.com/Logic-Xcution) where we help budding developers learn and grow by providing them with free mentorship, solving their doubts etc. When I found that most people busy with their college life, lack the motivation to do something productive, I started a facebook page called LX-MotiveX (https://www.facebook.com/LXMotiveX/) where I post motivational posts to inspire people. Currently I am working on an initiative called CodeToExpress which is my next step towards fulfilling the dream of a world where everyone is technically sound.

Along with all the technical, management and social skills, I look forward to learning more and more life values and philosophy and integrating them with my regular work life to be a better human as well.
