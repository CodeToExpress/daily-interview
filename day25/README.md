# Interview Discussion Day 25 -- Today's Topic

👨‍💻🌐 How to approach any coding question? Day 2 🌐👨‍💻

Yesterday we discussed about the 5 steps that I take while doing any coding question, so let's discuss those for a few days 😁

**👨‍🏫💭 1. Understand and Analyse the Problem 💭👨‍🏫**

Before starting to code, it is highly essential that you understand the problem fully 🖖

Read the problem, start thinking about it and if possible write the things that are given and the things that you need to find out on a piece of paper. 📄

Ask yourself these questions 💭🤔

👉 Are you able to understand the question fully?

👉 Would you be able to explain the question to a layman?

👉 What and how many inputs are required?

👉 What would be the output for those inputs

👉 Can you separate out some modules or parts from the problem?

👉 Do you have enough information? If not, try understanding the question again.

Analyzing the problem at the start helps you save the time you might have to spend in thinking again and again about the problem while actually writing the code 😁

Hope it helps 😃
