**🤔 "How many internships should I do as a student?" 🤔**


An interesting question indeed. I get this question quite often from my juniors in college. 😵
Before proceeding on how many internships should a student do, let's have a look at what's the need of doing an internship? 🧐

👉 Internships improve your profile

👉 If you do an internship you'll get an idea of how things work in the corporate industry

👉 Doing internships is compulsory in most of the Indian colleges, and now in engineering 3 internships are being made compulsory

👉 Learning new skills

👉 Building networks and connections

And there are many more importance as well like building skills like self confidence, good communication, professional etiquettes etc. 💫✨

With so many advantages of doing internships, doesn't the question "How many internships should I do" become baseless? A simple answer, as many as possible 😁

Also, not only as many internships, but in as many fields as possible. Clearly, college is the best time to work on and explore various fields in tech, and doing internships in diverse fields is good way to improve and prove your proficiency in multiple domains 💪
