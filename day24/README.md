# Interview Discussion Day 24 -- Today's Topic

**👨‍💻🌐 How to approach any coding question? 🌐👨‍💻**

A few days ago while doing a coding question, I found that I have a pattern in whatever problem I solve. 💭🤔
I did some more problems and kept writing down what all was there in my mind before and after I solve any problem. 📝 

To my surprise there was a common pattern, unknowingly I was doing these 5 things. Knowingly or unknowingly, even you might be following some of these steps but when you are aware of them you can use them to solve the problem more efficiently and learn more 🤩

👉 Analyze and understand the problem

👉 Have a look at sample inputs and use cases

👉 Break down the problem into smaller subparts, or functions, or modules

👉 Start solving/coding

👉 Once you are done, look back whether the code can be improved, is there any other way to solve the given problem

Hope it helps 😊
