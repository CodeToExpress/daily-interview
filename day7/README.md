# Interview Discussion Day 7 -- Today's Topic of Discussion

**_Whiteboard Interview Setting_**

If you are sitting for any tech or coding interview, most probably you are going to face a whiteboard interview round. So how does it look like? Let's Discuss it today 😁

So probably when it's your turn, you are going to walk into a sort of meeting room, with a whiteboard. After some basic talks your interviewer will take you to the whiteboard, write a problem on the board and you will be told to solve it. 

For example, he might write an array of unsorted integers on the board and ask you what sorting algorithm should you use for maximum efficiency and write the code (or, pseudocode) for it and also explain it.

In most cases you are allowed t use the language of your choice, still, you can ask "Which language can (or, should) I use", just to be sure.

So, here are some tips for your next whiteboard interview 😉

👉 Never be afraid to ask your "clarifying" questions, a question is better than a wrong assumption.

👉 Make use of your time efficiently, act quick (The interviewer won't wait for you till eternity)

👉 Practice coding questions regularly (Why not join our Daily Codes Initiative? 😉)

👉 Have mock interviews (Simulate the actual experience)

👉 See videos (youtube has got quite a lot of em) on whiteboard interviews

👉 Keep explaining your thought process to the interviewer (don't just stand their blank or write code silently)

👉 Stay calm and confident!
