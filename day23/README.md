# Interview Discussion Day 23 -- Today's Topic

**🤔💭 Are you ignoring Data Structures and Algorithms? 💭🤔**

Well you shouldn't. ❎

Coding isn't about learning the syntax of some language and making an application, it is just a part of a broad reality called Problem Solving. 🤩

Even if you are a developer there are tons of reason why you should work with algorithms, reasoning and competitive programming as well. And especially if you are a student, you should focus on these topic, here are some examples where data structures, algorithms, and competitive programming (in general) helps out students - 

👉 College Placements

👉 Writing good quality code 

👉 Efficient code (Time and space complexity)

👉 Making optimum use of resources

👉 Logical reasoning

👉 Exposure (there is a huge community of students who do CP)

👉 Opportunities (Tons of CP Contests out there)

👉 You will have a lot of fun in the process

Hope this post gives you enough motivation to start coding 😁
