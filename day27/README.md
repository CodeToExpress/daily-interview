# Interview Discussion Day 27 -- Today's Topic

👨‍💻🌐 How to approach any coding question? Day 4 🌐👨‍💻

Yesterday we saw the step 2 (importance of examples and edge cases) according to this article: https://hackernoon.com/how-to-approach-any-coding-problem-9230f3ad6f9 🤩
Moving on with the third step 😍

**📝 Break down the problem 📝**

This step is really very helpful when the problem at hand is very big. In such cases, I recommend the following,

👉 Try to make a flow chart or a UML for the problem in hand

👉 Divide the problem into different modules or sub-problems

👉 Try to make independent functions for each sub-problem

👉 Connect those sub-problems by calling them in the required order, or as necessary (Probably one function would be calling another)

👉 Try to use classes and objects while handling questions which try to implement some real-world problem (like management systems, etc.)
