# Interview Discussion Day 21 -- Today's Interview Question

**👨🏻‍💼👨‍🏫 How would you describe your ideal company? 👨‍🏫👨🏻‍💼**

Continuing our daily interview discussions, today let's look at another frequently asked question. "How would you describe your ideal company, location, and job?" 🤔💭

This question is quite useful when the interviewer wants to find out whether you are really initerested in joining the particular company and the role that is being offered 💼

A person applies for any company under 2 circumstances, either he/she loves the company and the role being offered, or he/she is in a need of job, no matter what the role is 💭

In both the cases, a good answer would include what "this" company is offering 🤭

Yes, so you might want to add these points in your answer

👉 The role that is being offered
👉 How "this" opportunity is attractive to you
👉 How the location of company is suitable to you
👉 Your previous experience in the role being offered
👉 How much you love that role
👉 Try to focus on the plus points of "this" company, which might include the work ethics, office culture, location, etc

Here's a blog which gives 3 sample answers to this question: https://www.campusgate.co.in/2014/02/describe-your-ideal-company-location.html

I loved this one the most:

This is my ideal company for which I’m interviewing for .  I love to work in a company where there is enough room to use my skills without fear but simultaneously acquire new skills from team mates and the projects.  I enjoy and look forward to learn something new on any given day so I can use the experience in the projects I work.  As far as location is concerned I’m presently a bachelor and ready to work anywhere as long as I’m comfortable with the culture, surroundings and the work environment and growth opportunities the company provides.
