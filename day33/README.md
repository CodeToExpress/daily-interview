# Interview Discussion Day 33 -- Today's Topic

🥋🥊 An effective way of conflict resolution? 🥊🥋

Conflicts are a part of any person's personal and professional life. Opinions vary from person to person, and some people take this difference of opinions in an unhealthy way which leads to conflicts. 😕

Conflict is never a result of a mistake of one person alone, we all know that it takes two to tango. But when a conflict arises, no one on either side would agree to accept their mistake, of course, "the ego issues" 😵🤐

If both the sides are left to talk and resolve the matter, there are high chances that the argument will increase, and become more intense 😳💣

My suggestion is that there should be a neutral third person who can arrange a meeting with the 2 sides, and let them talk peacefully, hear both of them and help sort things out or take the final decision 🤵🏻

The biggest example of this is the judiciary, isn't it? There are 2 sides, both get enough chance to speak, and let out everything that happened between them, and there is a completely neutral judge who goes through the matter in detail and either help sort out the things between them, and if this is not possible, announce the final decision on which side is right/wrong 🙇‍♂👨🏻‍⚖

What other methods would you propose? 💭
