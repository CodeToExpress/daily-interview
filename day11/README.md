# Interview Discussion Day 11 -- Today's Topic of discussion

**_What questions should I ask my interviewer_**

A good interview is never a one-sided conversation. It is a general mindset of people that interview = interviewer asking questions and you giving answers to them. The interviewer asking you questions is a part of interview, it is not the interview. 

In an interview, you are also free to ask some questions to your interviewer to clarify your doubts. Now don't go on asking random questions in your next interview just because I told it ðŸ˜‚

No matter what questions you ask or answers you give, always remember to maintain a professional behavior, the interviewer is not your friend. As long as your language and behaviour are professional, you are free to ask your questions.

So here are some sample questions that people generally ask in their interview: (source: https://careersidekick.com/questions-to-ask-the-interviewer/)

ðŸ‘‰ How will I be trained, and will I have a mentor?

ðŸ‘‰ What skills and experiences would make an ideal candidate for this position?

ðŸ‘‰ Can you tell me about the team Iâ€™ll be working with?

ðŸ‘‰ Who will I be working most closely with?

ðŸ‘‰ What do you see as the most challenging aspect of this job?

ðŸ‘‰ Is the work on this team more collaborative or independent?

ðŸ‘‰ Are there any skills missing on the current team that youâ€™re hoping to fill with me as a new hire?
and many more...
