# Interview Discussion Day 15 -- Today's Question

**Don't you think you are overqualified for this job?**

An interesting question indeed. There might be several reasons why your employer is asking this to you, it might be that he justs wants to test whether you are over confident or arrogant. But mostly, thtis question is asked when your employer might be concerned that you really are a bit overqualified and you might leave the job as soon as you get another job. So this question needs to be answered appropriately and you must convince your interviewer.

So here are my views âœŒ

ðŸ‘‰ Whenever you are applying for any job do go through the role you are applying for

ðŸ‘‰ If you really are overqualified, then you shouldn't apply for it, otherwise you yourself will be feeling bad in future while doing a role for which you are much over qualified

ðŸ‘‰ If you are not overqualified, and fully qualified then the job is a best fit

So if you are qualified and confident, you can deal with this question in a very polite and professional manner. The exact answer depends on your situation, it might be possible that you are in a dire need of job, or it might be that you just have the theoritical knowledge from your university, but now you need to work in industry etc. So the final answer can contain your reason as well.

Note that employers main concern is that if you are over qualified, you might leave the job in future, so any answer you give must demonstrate the sincerity of your commitment to the employer.
