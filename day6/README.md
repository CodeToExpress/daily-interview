# Interview Discussion Day 6 - Today's Question

**_What do you know about the company?_**

Whenever you are applying for any job always try to get as much knowledge as possible about the company and the role you are applying. There are high chances that you will be encountered with questions like "Why are you applying in our company only?", or "What makes you think our company needs you" etc. Moreover, having complete knowledge of the company clearly depicts how serious you are about joining the company. 

Suppose you are finding employees for your company, whom will you take, a person who knows about your company, it's functioning, and about the job profile well enough, or a person who just had his breakfast and came for the interview? The choice is clear, isn't it?

Here are some pieces of advice ðŸ˜ƒ 
- Go through employer's website, their vision, their products, their clients, their competitors and some basic things "About them"
- Explore a little about the job profile you are applying for.
- Search about the current condition of the company, whether it is financially growing or declining?
- Include some examples of the company in your answers (it shows that you know about the company!)
- Prepare well enough for the question "Why should we hire you", try to show that with you as an employee, it will greatly benefit the company.
