# Interview Discussion Day 30 -- Today's Question

**🤩😍 Short Notes on Important Topics in Tech 😍🤩**

I was receiving a lot of requests for short and easily understandable notes on various topics, so I am planning to start a series of short blogs on some important topics. 😃📚

**But why short notes? 🤔**

Short and concise blogs/notes of around 4 to 10 minutes reading time are interesting and increases knowledge. 🤩
So, take out 4–10 minutes regularly (Will post as them as much as I can 😄) to read the short notes and increase your knowledge in tech and programming

Here's the first one: "Some common runtime complexities and their meanings" 🏃‍♂

Comparing runtimes of different algorithms is where most of the computer science students get stuck, so here are some of the very common runtimes that you will come across

👉 Constant Runtime O(1)

👉 Logarithmic Runtime O(log(n))

👉 Linear Runtime O(n)

👉 Quasilinear Runtime O(n*log(n))

👉 Quadratic Runtime O(n^2)

👉 Exponential Runtime O(2^n)
