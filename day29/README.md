# Interview Discussion Day 29 -- Today's Topic

👨‍💻🌐 How to approach any coding question? Day 6 🌐👨‍💻

Yesterday we saw the step 4 (Coding phase) of problem solving according to this article: https://hackernoon.com/how-to-approach-any-coding-problem-9230f3ad6f9 💻👨‍💻

Now that you have actually wrote and solved the problem, you might think the job is done. Well, no, not yet, the job is not quite done 😅

**🧐📖 Look Back and Learn More 📖🧐**

Now, this is the most important part! Once you are done, look back whether the code can be improved, is there any other way to solve the given problem? 🤔💭

"Don’t just give up when you are done, give up when you feel content with the possible solution(s) and you’ve explored the problem completely!"

Here are some questions you should ask yourself once you are do-ne writing the code 🤩

👉 Does this code run for every possible input (including the edge cases)

👉 Is there any other way to solve the problem?

👉 Is the code efficient? Can it be more efficient?

👉 Is the code readable?

👉 If someone else showed you this code, would you be able to understand it?

👉 Can the performance be improved?

👉 Can some other algorithm be used which provides better results?

What do you think?
