# Interview Discussion Day 31 -- Today's Topic

**✅ Tips while writing a follow-up email ✅**

I seriously think that writing a followup mail is also a skill 🤩

There are many times when we need to write a followup mail, if you are a salesperson, you already know the importance, if you are looking for funding or sponsorship, again you are already aware of the importance of this, moreover, if you are just a fresher applying for a job, even you might have to send a followup mail in case your recruiter does not contact you for a weeks. 

So yeah, according to me, everyone should know this skill of writing a good followup mail which would increase the chances that the recipient reads the mail. 😍

So here are some tips ✨

👉 Give enough time, don't send a follow up email in a single day

👉 The subject should be clear and depict your reason for sending mail

👉 The body/content of the mail should be short, concise and clear

👉 Be polite and professional, Remember that the recipient is not bound to reply to your mails, and you can not compel them to do so

👉 Mention the references from old email

👉 Proofread the content

Apart from these, the most important thing that I keep in mind while sending mails is,
Whether you would read the mail if someone sent the same mail to you? Or would you just ignore it?

Do add your points to this list, eager to hear your views 😃
