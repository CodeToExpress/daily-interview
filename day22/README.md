# Interview Discussion Day 22 -- Today's Topic of discussion

**⭐👨🏻‍💼 Importance of mock interviews 👨🏻‍💼⭐**

All those who have attempted any interview, or are going to attempt any job interview might have heard from many people to do as many mock interviews as possible, wonder why? 💭🤔

Here are some of the reasons I tell everyone to go through several mock interviews before sitting in the real interview

👉 Consistent practice develops skill

👉 Mock interviews help to reduce the stress and anxiety about interviews

👉 Interviews won't feel difficult after continuous practice

👉 It increases your confidence

👉 You get to analyse yourself, where you went wrong and where you were good

👉 Getting continuous feedbacks

👉 Develop that body language that is needed in behavioral interviews through continuous practice

and apart from these, of course when you practise a lot for something, fear becomes excitement 😍😁
