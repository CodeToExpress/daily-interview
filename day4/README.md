# Interview Discussion Day 3 - Today's Topic

_**What are your “Weaknesses”?**_

Again, this is also a question which you are most likely to come across in any interview you give. Also, this is asked just after “What are your biggest strengths”, and since we discussed the strengths yesterday, today it’s the time for weaknesses.

Yeah, it is the question that we all tend to ignore. Of course, Who would like to tell the interviewer that “I am bad” at something. If you be honest here, you would end up saying your weaknesses, and if you lie, you will be easily caught.

### Here’s a common tactic to handle such a question:

_Disguising a strength as a weakness_

Generally, people try to fake strength as a weakness. For example, someone might say that `My biggest weakness is that I am a real hard worker and sometimes I push myself so hard that it affects my health on long term and even some of the members of the team might not be accustomed to it`

But this type of answer is clearly visible to any experienced to any interviewer, and he can easily find out that you are trying to be over smart.

So a better option would be telling your real weaknesses but never say any weakness that would be harmful to the work environment or might bring the company in a loss.

Also, an additional point will be to admit your weakness and also tell the steps you are taking to remove that weakness.
