# Interview Discussion Day 28 -- Today's Topic

👨‍💻🌐 How to approach any coding question? Day 5 🌐👨‍💻

Yesterday we saw the step 3 (Breaking down the problem in hand) according to this article: https://hackernoon.com/how-to-approach-any-coding-problem-9230f3ad6f9 📝
Now that we are done with the 3 steps, the next step is to actually code 👨‍💻

**✨👨‍🏫 Start solving/coding 👨‍🏫✨**

Now that you’ve analyzed the problem it’s time to actually write the code. If you can’t solve the problem fully at once, try writing code for a simpler sub part, as you solve the problem, gradually you keep figuring out the problem in more detail, and you start getting new ideas.

Just keep in mind 3 things, and you’ll surely figure out the path 😁

👉 The point where you started

👉 Where are you right now?

👉 What is your destination?

Also, when you are giving some interview, do not waste time in figuring out the whole solution and then tell your interviewer, keep simplifying the problem and keep telling your interviewer about how you are approaching the problem 🙌🙌

What do you think?
