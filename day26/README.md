# Interview Discussion Day 26 -- Today's Topic

👨‍💻🌐 How to approach any coding question? Day 3 🌐👨‍💻

So yesterday we discussed about the importance of Understanding and analyzing the problem, today we'll be discussing about the 2nd step which I wrote in my article: https://hackernoon.com/how-to-approach-any-coding-problem-9230f3ad6f9

**👥📖 Importance of examples and edge cases 📖👥**

I wrote about this a couple of weeks ago as well, and taking up this topic again so that we can discuss about the five steps continuously 😁

Going through some sample inputs and coming up with more examples sure helps you a lot to understand the problem well, and moreover, it gives you a clear way to how many cases your code should handle, and what all can be the possible output or output range.

Here’s what I would suggest,

🤜 Take very simple examples and find the output

🤜 Take more complex and bigger inputs to see what will be the output, how many use cases do we want

Then, “Time to handle the edge cases”

👉 Try out the problem with no input, what should be the output now

👉 Try out the problem with invalid input, what should be the output now

Do share your views 🤩
