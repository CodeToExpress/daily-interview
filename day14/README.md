# Interview Discussion Day 14 -- Today's Question

**What are your hobbies**

Again this is a frequently asked question in any HR interview. But what does interviewer have to do with your hobbies? Seems pretty weird right? Actually it matters, your hobbies clearly show how well you balance your persoal and professional life, so it's quite important to answer this question with high enthusiasm. Who wouldn't like enthusiastic and optimistic employees in his company ðŸ˜‰

Here are some of my views what you should consider while answering this question

ðŸ‘‰ Tell the truth

Here's a sample answer from this blog [naukri.com](https://www.naukri.com/blog/what-are-your-hobbies-interview-questions/)

```
I have always been a very creative person and find it relaxing to indulge in craft activities. There is a new modern term for this; â€˜Do-It-Yourselfâ€™ or DIY.  It largely means to create handmade products and includes a gamut of different crafts. Most of these ideas are relatively cheap and I love taking on new projects for home improvement. Iâ€™ve made coasters, revamped old dressers, painted a new lampshade, and stitched soft furnishings in the last 3 months alone. It keeps me occupied and enables me to think on my feet to create new designs. Furthermore, I am lucky that I can make personalized gifts for close friends and family. Itâ€™s a gesture they never forget!
