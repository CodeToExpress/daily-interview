# Interview Discussion Day 13 -- Today's Topic of Discussion

**Reasons behind the tricky and "Not So Pleasent" interview questions**

Ever thought why does the interviewer tries to drill you? Especially in an HR interview, intentionally those questions are asked which might make you uncomfortable, but why? What's the need for behavioral and stress interviews?

So, I was reading this book, "The No Asshole Rule: Building a Civilized Workplace and Surviving One That Isn't", indeed it gives a great insight on the importance of a healthy environment in any workspace, and dealing/surviving one that isn't.

In an interview, not only your skills are tested but your nature as well. You might be technically very strong, but if you are not culturally fit for the company, you won't get in. So here are some things that interviewers check during these interviews:

ðŸ‘‰ Nature and Behaviour

ðŸ‘‰ Team work

ðŸ‘‰ Work Ethics

ðŸ‘‰ Rasoning

ðŸ‘‰ Temperament

ðŸ‘‰ Ability to adapt

ðŸ‘‰ Emotions

ðŸ‘‰ Dedication towards work and Sincerity

ðŸ‘‰ Confidence

ðŸ‘‰ Handling Pressure

ðŸ‘‰ Command over language and communication skills

ðŸ‘‰ Self branding

ðŸ‘‰ Loyality

ðŸ‘‰ General behaviour and response to negative conditions
