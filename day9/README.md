# Interview Discussion Day 9 -- Today's Topic of discussion

**The In-Interview Silence**

The 2 most dreaded silences are the "in-interview" and the "post-interview" silence. 
Let's discuss about the in-interview silence today and the latter tomorrow. 

So, suppose you answer a question that your interviewer asked you, and then instead of asking another question, your interviewer just stares you silently, or the interviewer looks in your eyes and says "ARE YOU SURE", followed by a few minutes of silence. How would you react? 

Yes, it is a general method used to test how would you act under stress. 
Probably you are going to say that "Yes sir, I am sure I answered it correctly" at start, but then you would start doubting yourself. You start getting anxious and worrying about the same, self-doubt increases. Not only after some tech answer, but this can also happen after any general question like "Why do you want to join our company", or "What are your weaknesses", just to make you think that you answered in a wrong way.

Here are some tips to counter the in-interview silence

ðŸ‘‰ Have faith in yourself

ðŸ‘‰ Don't try to cover up that silence by start telling bullshit stories

ðŸ‘‰ Don't try to extend your answer just to fill up that silent gap (Never tell any irrelevant information)

ðŸ‘‰ Even if you are unsure whether the answer was correct or not, don't let your self-doubt be visible on your face (Keep thinking in your mind whether you answered correctly, but don't let your facial expressions reveal that you are scared)

ðŸ‘‰ If nothing works out, politely ask your interviewer "Is there anything else you would like to know?"
