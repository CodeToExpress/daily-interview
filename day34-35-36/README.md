**ğŸ¤” Importance of searching and sorting algorithms? ğŸ¤”**

From past 2 weeks in our daily codes initiative, we are doing the various searching and sorting algorithms.

All in all, we did these algorithms

ğŸ’¥ Search ğŸ’¥

ğŸ‘‰ Linear

ğŸ‘‰ Binary

ğŸ‘‰ Naive String Search

ğŸ‘‰ KMP

ğŸ’¥ Sorting ğŸ’¥

ğŸ‘‰ Bubble Sort

ğŸ‘‰ Selection Sort

ğŸ‘‰ Insertion Sort

ğŸ‘‰ Merge Sort

ğŸ‘‰ Quick Sort

ğŸ‘‰ Radix Sort

Now since we have put in so much time into it, let's know why is it important to know various algorithms

ğŸ‘‰ Almost every application needs to search data

ğŸ‘‰ Nobody would like to use an app which takes too much time searching for data

ğŸ‘‰ While implementing programs, one needs to take care of time it takes to execute

ğŸ‘‰ Different algorithms prove to be useful in different cases, and hence a good programmer knows when to choose which one

ğŸ‘‰ Just like searching, sorting is too very important

ğŸ‘‰ A sorted collection of data makes it easier to apply other operations on it (Example: It is easier and faster to locate items in a sorted list than unsorted)

ğŸ‘‰ Building efficient programs, (When the number of elements are very high, say 500k, applying bubble sort would make the program very slow)

Keep adding to the list ğŸ¤©
